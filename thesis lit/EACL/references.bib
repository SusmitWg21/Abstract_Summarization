  abstract  = {Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR) is a semantic representation for natural
	language that embeds annotations related to traditional tasks such as named
	entity recognition, semantic role labeling, word sense disambiguation and
	co-reference resolution. We describe a transition-based parser for AMR that
	parses sentences left-to-right, in linear time. We further propose a test-suite
	that assesses specific subtasks that are helpful in comparing AMR parsers, and 
	show that our parser is competitive with the state of the art on the LDC2015E86
	dataset and that it outperforms state-of-the-art parsers for recovering named
	entities and handling polarity.},

2) Cutting-off Redundant Repeating Generations for Neural Abstractive Summarization
@InProceedings{suzuki-nagata:2017:EACLshort,
  author    = {Suzuki, Jun  and  Nagata, Masaaki},
  title     = {Cutting-off Redundant Repeating Generations for Neural Abstractive Summarization},
  booktitle = {Proceedings of the 15th Conference of the European Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Volume 2, Short Papers},
  month     = {April},
  year      = {2017},
  address   = {Valencia, Spain},
  publisher = {Association for Computational Linguistics},
  pages     = {291--297},
  abstract  = {This paper tackles the reduction of redundant repeating generation that is
	often observed in RNN-based encoder-decoder models.
	 Our basic idea is to jointly estimate the upper-bound frequency of each target
	vocabulary in the encoder and control the output words based on the estimation
	in the decoder.
	 Our method shows significant improvement over a strong RNN-based
	encoder-decoder baseline and achieved its best results on an abstractive
	summarization benchmark.},

3) Addressing the Data Sparsity Issue in Neural AMR Parsing

  address   = {Valencia, Spain},
  publisher = {Association for Computational Linguistics},
  pages     = {366--375},
  abstract  = {Neural attention models have achieved great success in different NLP tasks.
	How- ever, they have not fulfilled their promise on the AMR parsing task due to
	the data sparsity issue. In this paper, we de- scribe a sequence-to-sequence
	model for AMR parsing and present different ways to tackle the data sparsity
	problem. We show that our methods achieve significant improvement over a
	baseline neural attention model and our results are also competitive against
	state-of-the-art systems that do not use extra linguistic resources.},

  title     = {Unsupervised AMR-Dependency Parse Alignment},

  publisher = {Association for Computational Linguistics},
  pages     = {558--567},
  abstract  = {In this paper, we introduce an Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR) to
	Dependency Parse aligner. Alignment is a preliminary step for AMR parsing, and
	our aligner improves current AMR parser performance. Our aligner involves
	several different features, including named entity tags and semantic role
	labels, and uses Expectation-Maximization training. Results show that our
	aligner reaches an 87.1% F-Score score with the experimental data, and enhances
	AMR parsing.},
